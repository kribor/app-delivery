# General information about Higher Vocational Education (HVE)

## What is HVE?
Higher Vocational Education (Yrkeshögskolan) is a post-secondary form of education that combines theoretical and practical studies in close cooperation with employers and industry. Programmes are offered in specific fields where there is an explicit demand for competence.

## How does it work?
A programme normally has several periods of workplace training (LIA). These periods make up approximately 25 % of programme content.
Workplace training gives the students the opportunity – even during their studies – to learn a great deal about the profession they are aiming for and offers an opportunity to combine theory with practice. At the same time, the employer has the opportunity to get to know a potential future employee.
Workplace training provides excellent opportunities to build up a network of contacts with potential employers.
Programme duration is from six months and up. Most programmes are between one and two years in duration.

## Credit system
Duration is specified through HVE-credits (YH-poäng), where five credits correspond to one week of full-time studies. 100 HVE-credits correspond to six months of full-time studies, 200 HVE-credits to one year of full-time studies, 400 HVE-credits to two years of full-time studies etc.
Students may not automatically transfer credits from an HVE programme into further studies at university. Each university has the right to decide whether credits can be transferred or not.

## Graduation
In order for an HVE programme to result in an award on graduation, it must have a minimum duration of one year.
The following awards exist:
Higher Vocational Education Diploma (Yrkeshögskoleexamen)
Advanced Higher Vocational Education Diploma (Kvalificerad yrkeshögskoleexamen)

## What are the entry requirements for an HVE programme?
There are certain entry requirements that need fulfilment to enrol on a Higher Vocational Education programme. This is referred to as eligibility. In a situation where there are more applicants to an HVE programme than there are study places, a selection has to be made to decide which applicants will be offered a study place.
Entry requrements may be different for different programmes, as prior knowledge is taken into consideration for each programme. There are also different types of selection procedures in different programmes.
Each education provider (school) handles their own admissions process in their programmes.

## Higher Vocational Education eligibility
To fulfil the entry requirements for HVE, you must have the prior knowledge equivalent to upper-secondary education. However, the rules are generous and applicants of varying backgrounds are given an opportunity to demonstrate fulfilment of entry requirements.

## General entry requirements for HVE are met if you:
have received a school leaving certificate from a full national upper-secondary school programme, or a school leaving certificate from adult education at upper-secondary level,
hold Swedish or foreign qualifications equivalent to the requirements stated under 1,
are a resident of Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway and there fulfil the entry requirements for study pro­grammes equivalent to the Swedish HVE programmes, or
hold Swedish or foreign qualifications, or if you have through practical experience or other circumstance obtained the prerequisites needed in order to fulfil the programme requirements.



## Specific entry requirements
Many HVE programmes require specific prior knowledge beyond the general entry requirements. These may vary in different programmes. It may involve completion of specific courses from a national programme at upper-secondary level or specific professional experience. Contact the education provid­er (school) directly to find out what the specific requirements are for the programme of your choice.

### Knowledge of Swedish
If your first language is other than Swedish, Dan­ish, Norwegian, Icelandic or Faroese, you must have the necessary knowledge of the Swedish language. The education provider tests and determines whether you have the necessary knowledge.
Some programmes offer opportunities for extra-curricular support if your first language is other than Swedish in the form of job-related Swedish language training.

### Exemptions
Should you not fulfil the formal entry requirements, there is still a chance to gain entry to a programme. The education provider may, under special circumstances, exempt the applicant if he or she is judged capable enough to fulfil the requirements of the programme and to practise the profession for which the programme pre­pares. Contact the education provider to find out whether this opportunity is available for the programme of your choice.

Selection and admissions
In a situation where there are more applicants to an HVE pro­gramme than there are study places, a selection has to be made among the applicants.
Selection procedures vary in different programmes. You may be asked to take a written test or go to an interview. Grades, prior education or professional experience may also be taken into consideration.
Each education provider (school) handles their own admissions process in their programmes. If you have any questions regarding admissions, please contact the education provider directly.
