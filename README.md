# App Delivery (something)
To build an deliver software apps today you need alot of knowledge and knowledge of the app in the full lifeteime of the apps. How that app is build, How that apps is then deployed and how the app behaves when it run.

During the years we have learn alot how we best build and run apps. This include new tools to easy build ore run our apps. But also diffrent way to work like GitOPS and Devops.


This course aims at teaching students with the basic of the App delivery (Something)



## Learning 
Today we learn by solving problems. We se a new problem that we need to soleve. We now read guide, Watch videos and test out new tools untill this problems is solved.
This education teach the student how to learn in this way to solve problems.

In the field knowledge changes so fast. So to make shoure the students are always getting the latest info we shift the classrom.
The students are to take diffrent courses done by professinals online ore onsite. And then we give the school the assimgment to help the students pass this diffrent courses.

## The Course


### The App 
To get the full understaing of what problems we can get when working in a applications chain every student will get there own app.
They can build this app by them self if they have the knowledge ore be given one.
The app is then taken throw the diffrent stages during the course. 

### Docs
To work with the app documations is a important part. It can be documations in code but also how the app work and Runbooks.
The student are to during the course write docs abount the app and also store all there code in public git.
This will later be a good ref for allying for work.

### Tickets 
All companies today work by ticket system. You get assigne a ticket with a problem that you are to solve. We want the eductaions to be as close to work as possible and there for all students are to work by ticket systems.

### Cloud Service
Cloud service is something everyone in  app delivery need to know. Most of the steps in the cpurse will be run against clous service and the stdents will have good knowledge in to work with clous providers after to course.

## We all run in diffrent speed
We all run in diffrent speed and here we want to setup the courses to match the speed of the students. The course will have a solid and easy beat that all students are able to keep up.
But if you as students quckly passes a course we will have more courses for you to att so that you can deep dive on diffrent topics.
Say you as a student really get into coding. Then you will not only have a solid App Delivery course but you my also have passed diffrent coding courses as well.


## Courses from professional
To keep the level of the courses we will get courses from online services. We we then combine this courses into a learning path and that path will be the path for this course.
Example of online resourse will be
- [DevSecOps Academy](https://www.devsecops-academy.com/)
- [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/)

### Certification
Certification are a important evidence that you proven to have a certian skill.
During this course the studentd will be preperd to take cerification in

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git
- AWS,GCP,Azure 
- Vault

And more

## The stages
To make in more clear and easy. The course is devided into 3 stages Build , Deploy and Run.
In the build stage we learn how to setup a local dveelpoing enviroment and the basics in programming. In the stege deploy we learn how to deploy and test our applications.
In the stage run we work on our applications to make in run and scale.

### Build
Its all starting with the code. Here we work in setting the foundation correcnt and then start making our app.
We work with the following tolls 

Some of the things we are to work with:
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Programing (Python ore NodeJS)
- Webb Basic (How the webb work CND/ LB and HTTP request)
- Databases and service (Mysql, MongoDB , Redis and more)
- Cloud service (Basic setup)

### Deploy (CI/CD)
Testing you app correct is a fundation in building a CI/CD pipline. And in this step we are to setup diffrent pipline and start testing our app.

Some of the things we are to work with:
- Buildservers (jenkins, tekton and more)
- Autoamtes test 
- Vurnibulity scanning
- Kubernetes and helm 

### Run
To deploy a application is easy to run it dfor a long time is hard. In this step the student will learn how to setup envirments that scale and are secure. And learn how to monitor and trubbelshot there applictaions

Some of the things we are to work with:
- Terraform / Pullumi
- Imutabel Infrastructure
- Observity (Logs, Metrics,Tracing)
- Load test
- Alerts
- Runbooks




## Background
During 2021 and after heling many student from diffrent eductaions we come to se that we miss some knowledge in the studnet from [yrkesutbildning](yrkesutbildning.md) students.

One of the key thigs we missed was the own engine. To stand infron of a problem not knowing how to solve it.
But knosing how to get the wisdom to.

We that worked with this course are [team](team.md) and during 2022 we toghter with the Swedish school [tuc](tuc.md) hope run the eductaions.
